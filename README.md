Mail-in-a-Box
=============

By [@JoshData](https://github.com/JoshData) and [contributors](https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox/graphs/contributors).

Mail-in-a-Box helps individuals take back control of their email by defining a one-click, easy-to-deploy SMTP+everything else server: a mail server in a box.

**Please see [https://mailinabox.email](https://mailinabox.email) for the upstream project's website and setup guide!**

This Fork
---------

This is a privacy-focused fork of Mail-in-a-Box. On top of everything upstream provides, it adds:

* **A modern React control panel** served at `/admin`. The classic panel is still available at `/admin-old`.
* **At-rest PGP encryption of incoming mail.** Upload a per-account public key in the control panel and new mail to that account is encrypted (PGP/MIME) before it touches disk. Accounts without a key are unaffected.
* **Passkey (WebAuthn) two-factor login** for the control panel, alongside the existing authenticator-app (TOTP) option. (Passkeys need an optional dependency; see [`setup/management.sh`](setup/management.sh).)
* **Webmail blocks remote images by default**, so tracking pixels don't load until you choose to show them.

See [`security.md`](security.md) for the security details and caveats, and [`PRIVACY-ROADMAP.md`](PRIVACY-ROADMAP.md) for what's next.

### Install (fresh Ubuntu 22.04 machine)

```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aguycalled/mailinabox/main/setup.sh | sudo bash
```

This clones the fork and runs the normal Mail-in-a-Box setup. You can pin a different branch or repo with environment variables, e.g. `... | sudo BRANCH=mybranch bash`.

### Migrating from a stock (legacy) Mail-in-a-Box

Your mail, settings, and users live in `/home/user-data` and are **not** modified by switching to this fork, so migration is low-risk. Take a backup first either way.

**Option A — in-place upgrade (same machine).** Convert an existing Mail-in-a-Box box to this fork by pointing its checkout at the fork and re-running setup:

```
cd $HOME/mailinabox
git remote add fork https://github.com/aguycalled/mailinabox
git fetch fork
git checkout -B main fork/main
sudo setup/start.sh
```

Setup is idempotent: it reconfigures the box, installs the new control panel at `/admin`, and leaves your data in place. It restarts Postfix/Dovecot, so expect a brief mail interruption. Your existing logins, the classic panel (now at `/admin-old`), and the public API at `/admin/*` keep working.

**Option B — fresh machine + restore (cleanest).** Stand up a new Ubuntu 22.04 server, install this fork with the one-liner above using the **same primary hostname**, then restore your old box's encrypted backup from `/home/user-data/backup` onto it (copy the backup directory over and follow the upstream [backup/restore guide](https://mailinabox.email/maintenance.html)). Finally, repoint your DNS/glue records at the new machine.

After migrating, review the new privacy features in the control panel: upload PGP keys under **Users → Encryption**, and add a passkey under **Two-Factor Auth**.

* * *

Our goals are to:

* Make deploying a good mail server easy.
* Promote [decentralization](http://redecentralize.org/), innovation, and privacy on the web.
* Have automated, auditable, and [idempotent](https://web.archive.org/web/20190518072631/https://sharknet.us/2014/02/01/automated-configuration-management-challenges-with-idempotency/) configuration.
* **Not** make a totally unhackable, NSA-proof server.
* **Not** make something customizable by power users.

Additionally, this project has a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which supersedes the goals above. Please review it when joining our community.


In The Box
----------

Mail-in-a-Box turns a fresh Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 64-bit machine into a working mail server by installing and configuring various components.

It is a one-click email appliance. There are no user-configurable setup options. It "just works."

The components installed are:

* SMTP ([postfix](http://www.postfix.org/)), IMAP ([Dovecot](http://dovecot.org/)), CardDAV/CalDAV ([Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/)), and Exchange ActiveSync ([z-push](http://z-push.org/)) servers
* Webmail ([Roundcube](http://roundcube.net/)), mail filter rules (thanks to Roundcube and Dovecot), and email client autoconfig settings (served by [nginx](http://nginx.org/))
* Spam filtering ([spamassassin](https://spamassassin.apache.org/)) and greylisting ([postgrey](http://postgrey.schweikert.ch/))
* DNS ([nsd4](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/nsd/)) with [SPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework), DKIM ([OpenDKIM](http://www.opendkim.org/)), [DMARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC), [DNSSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNSSEC), [DANE TLSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities), [MTA-STS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8461), and [SSHFP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4255) policy records automatically set
* TLS certificates are automatically provisioned using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for protecting https and all of the other services on the box
* Backups ([duplicity](http://duplicity.nongnu.org/)), firewall ([ufw](https://launchpad.net/ufw)), intrusion protection ([fail2ban](http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)), and basic system monitoring ([munin](http://munin-monitoring.org/))

It also includes system management tools:

* Comprehensive health monitoring that checks each day that services are running, ports are open, TLS certificates are valid, and DNS records are correct
* A control panel for adding/removing mail users, aliases, custom DNS records, configuring backups, etc.
* An API for all of the actions on the control panel

Internationalized domain names are supported and configured easily (but SMTPUTF8 is not supported, unfortunately).

It also supports static website hosting since the box is serving HTTPS anyway. (To serve a website for your domains elsewhere, just add a custom DNS "A" record in you Mail-in-a-Box's control panel to point domains to another server.)

For more information on how Mail-in-a-Box handles your privacy, see the [security details page](security.md).


Installation
------------

See the [setup guide](https://mailinabox.email/guide.html) for detailed, user-friendly instructions.

For experts, start with a completely fresh (really, I mean it) Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 64-bit machine. On the machine...

Clone this repository and checkout the tag corresponding to the most recent release (which you can find in the tags or releases lists on GitHub):

	$ git clone https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox
	$ cd mailinabox
	$ git checkout TAGNAME

Begin the installation.

	$ sudo setup/start.sh

The installation will install, uninstall, and configure packages to turn the machine into a working, good mail server.

For help, DO NOT contact Josh directly --- I don't do tech support by email or tweet (no exceptions).

Post your question on the [discussion forum](https://discourse.mailinabox.email/) instead, where maintainers and Mail-in-a-Box users may be able to help you.

Note that while we want everything to "just work," we can't control the rest of the Internet. Other mail services might block or spam-filter email sent from your Mail-in-a-Box.
This is a challenge faced by everyone who runs their own mail server, with or without Mail-in-a-Box. See our discussion forum for tips about that.

The History
-----------

* In 2007 I wrote a relatively popular Mozilla Thunderbird extension that added client-side SPF and DKIM checks to mail to warn users about possible phishing: [add-on page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/thunderbird/addon/sender-verification-anti-phish/), [source](https://github.com/JoshData/thunderbird-spf).
* In August 2013 I began Mail-in-a-Box by combining my own mail server configuration with the setup in ["NSA-proof your email in 2 hours"](http://sealedabstract.com/code/nsa-proof-your-e-mail-in-2-hours/) and making the setup steps reproducible with bash scripts.
* Mail-in-a-Box was a semifinalist in the 2014 [Knight News Challenge](https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/2014/submissions/mail-in-a-box), but it was not selected as a winner.
* Mail-in-a-Box hit the front page of Hacker News in [April](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7634514) 2014, [September](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8276171) 2014, [May](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9624267) 2015, and [November](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13050500) 2016.
* FastCompany mentioned Mail-in-a-Box a [roundup of privacy projects](http://www.fastcompany.com/3047645/your-own-private-cloud) on June 26, 2015.
